# Crash course for data analysis in R

Thank you for signing up to attend this session organised by the [SaSH](https://nsamr.ac.uk/blog/sash/) group - a collaboration between the [BNTRC](https://www.bntrc.org.uk/) and the [NSAMR](https://nsamr.ac.uk/). The aim of this session is to introduce the day-to-day tasks associated with data cleaning and analysis using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 


# Setting up

You need to install the required softwares to follow the session on your own computer. These are:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

You should also create a folder / directory on your computer to store the files on Github. Once you have installed R and RStudio, you should download the files above and ensure that they are in your designated folder / directory.

# Disclaimer

All data provided above are synthetic data based on the SaSH study. Therefore, no actual patient data is released and results may be different when performing the same analyses on the actual SaSH dataset. 

This crash course is by no means comprehensive. There are many aspects of R programming that cannot be incorporated into the session due to time constraints. For a free, focused and practical online resource, please check out [R for health data science](https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/).
